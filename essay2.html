            <h1 class="title">Union with Christ</h1>
            <p>There are three characteristics of our union with Christ. The first characteristic of this
            wonderful doctrine that Erickson expounds is that union with Christ is judicial in nature.
            Erickson links how God evaluates humanity to our union with Christ. In union with Christ, God
            views the believer and Christ as one. The assets of Christ are then possessed by the believer and
            then legally the two are viewed as one.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second characteristic of union with Christ is that the union with Christ is spiritual.
            This characteristic has two facets. First, the union is affected by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit
            brings us into union with Christ as expressed in I Corinthians 12:13 and Romans 8:9-11. From
            this, we see the Spirit is the bond of union with Christ. The second facet of this characteristic is
            that union with Christ is a union of spirits. The believer's spirit is in union with Christ's spirit,
            and that union produces a spiritual vitality within the human that did not exist otherwise.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The final characteristic of union with Christ is that union with Christ is a vital union. The
            life of Christ flows into the life of the believer and renews the believer's inner nature. Jesus's
            metaphor of the vine and the branches is a true metaphor that illustrates the vital nature of union
            with Christ and shows the sheer necessity of the union as individuals are lifeless apart from
            union with Christ, the true vine.

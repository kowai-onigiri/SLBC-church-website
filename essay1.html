            <h1 class="title">Forensic Justification</h1>
            <p>Several objections to forensic justification have been posed and the responsibility of
            answering objections falls to whom articulates the position to which is objected. Thus, Erickson
            responds to objections about his position of forensic justification. The first objection that
            Erickson treats is the objection that forensic justification is a legal fiction. This objection takes
            issue with forensic justification by claiming that forensic justification is an impossibility, a
            deception on the part of God that cannot be true. This objection denies that righteousness can be
            imputed to a sinner; instead, people must be counted righteous on their own merits, not the merit
            of another. Erikson's response is based on the constitutive nature of justification, that through the
            imputed righteousness of Christ, sinners are made righteous through union with Christ. I like
            Erikson's response to this objection and the analogy of marriage that he uses to explain it.</p>
            <p>The second objection is that virtue cannot be transferred from one party to another.
            Erickson's answer to this simple objection involves the believer's union with Christ once again.
            Within this union, the spiritual assets and liabilities of the believer, which means that God looks
            upon the imputed righteousness as the righteousness of Christ, not merely as a transferred
            righteousness. This interfaces with an understanding of justification as a gift that is seen in the
            Pauline writings. I would agree with Erickson's argumentation. I se justification as the
            righteousness of Christ forensically viewed on our behalf through union with Christ.  
            </p>
            <p>
            The third objection that Erickson addresses is that posed by the proponents of the New
            Perspective on Paul. This objection sees the forensic view of justification as a fundamental
            misunderstanding of the Pauline materials. Instead of Paul coming to Judaism as a legalistic
            approach to meriting salvation, Paul is dialoging with Judaizers who insist that Paul's Gentile
            converts should be circumcised. In the NPP, Judaism was viewed as a religion of a gracious
            response to God's covenant, and law-keeping was an outflow of grace. The objection was that
            justification was a contextualized teaching that was situation specific. Erickson addresses this by
            surveying the biblical evidence that demonstrates the doctrine being emphasized beyond the
            Judaizers' controversy.   
            </p>
            <p>
            A final objection is the debate between imputed and imparted righteousness in Protestant
            circles. This position blends justification and sanctification, using Romans 2 to assert that the
            final judgement is based on works. Erickson's response is that the classic Protestant view is not
            inadequate, but proper emphasis must be placed on life transformation and that justification and
            sanctification are distinct, but they always exist together. I concur with Erickson and agree that
            the Jewish/Western distinction that is emphasized by NPP scholars is highly dubious.
